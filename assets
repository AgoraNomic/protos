Rule 2166/26 (Power=3.0)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by a document that has been
      granted Mint Authority by the Rules (hereafter the asset's backing 
      document), and existing solely because its backing document defines 
      its existence. An asset's backing document can specify when and how 
      that asset is created, destroyed, and transferred.
      
      Each asset has exactly one owner. If an asset would otherwise lack
      an owner, it is owned by Agora. If an asset's backing document
      restricts its ownership to a class of entities, then that asset
      CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity outside that
      class, and is destroyed if it is owned by an entity outside that
      class (except if it is owned by Agora, in which case any player
      CAN transfer or destroy it without objection). The restrictions in
      the previous sentence are subject to modification by its backing
      document.
      
      Unless modified by an asset's backing document, ownership of an
      asset is restricted to Agora, players, and contracts. As an
      exception to the last sentence, non-player persons are generally
      able to own assets defined by a contract they are a party to,
      subject to modification by the contract in question.
      
      A contract's text can specify whether or not that contract is
      willing to receive assets or a class of assets. Generally, a
      contract CANNOT be given assets it is unwilling to receive. If the
      contract is silent on the matter, or if its willingness is
      indeterminate or the subject of a inextricable conditional, the
      procedure to determine its willingness is as follows:
      
        1. If the contract appears to anticipate being given assets,
           other than for sustenance (e.g. by authorizing parties to
           spend the contract's assets), then the contract is willing to
           receive all assets.
      
        2. Otherwise, it is unwilling to receive all assets.
      
      The previous paragraph (including the list) notwithstanding, a
      contract CAN be given 1 unit of Agora’s official currency a month
      for its sustenance payment, so long as it never has more than 1
      unit of Agora’s official currency at a time.
      
      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
      defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That
      entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class and
      their owners. This portion of that entity's report is
      self-ratifying. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a contract
      CANNOT oblige a person who isn't a member to record its internal
      state, nor is the default recordkeepor responsible for tracking a
      contract's internal state. For the purposes of this rule, the
      promulgator of a regulation is bound by it.
      
      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
      subject to modification by its backing document. An indestructible
      asset is one defined as such by it backing document, and CANNOT be
      destroyed except by a proposal or rule, other than this one,
      specifically addressing the destruction of indestructible assets
      or that asset in particular; any other asset is destructible. In
      circumstances where another asset would be destroyed, an
      indestructible asset is generally transferred to Agora, subject to
      modification by its backing document and the intervention of other
      rules.
      
      To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed from one's possession;
      to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to destroy it from that
      entity's possession.
      
      An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. paid, given) by
      announcement by its owner to another entity, subject to
      modification by its backing document. A fixed asset is one defined
      as such by its backing document, and CANNOT be transferred; any
      other asset is liquid.
      
      When a rule indicates transferring an amount that is not a natural
      number, the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural
      number.
      
      A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
      document. Instances of a currency with the same owner are
      fungible.
      
      The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number
      of x that entity possesses. If a rule, proposal, or other
      competent authority attempts to increase or decrease the balance
      of an entity without specifying a source or destination, then the
      currency is created or destroyed as needed.
      
      When a player causes one or more balances to change, e is
      ENCOURAGED to specify the resulting balance(s). Players SHOULD NOT
      specify inaccurate balances.
      
      Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset or currency being referred
      to is the currency designated as "Agora's official currency", if
      there is one.
      
      An asset or class of assets is private, rather than public, if its
      backing document is a contract.

      that different types of entity can be Mint Authorities:
      
      (a) rule, (b)
      authorized regulation, (c) group of rules and/or authorized
      regulations (but if such regulations modify a preexisting asset
      class defined by a rule or another title of regulations, they must
